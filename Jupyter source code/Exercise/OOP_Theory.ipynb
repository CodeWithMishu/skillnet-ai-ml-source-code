    "## Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming is basically a way of writing code that's inspired by how we think about real-world objects. Instead of just writing functions that do stuff, you create objects that have both data and methods together. It's like thinking of your program as a collection of things that can interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that you bundle related data and functions into objects, which makes your code more organized and easier to understand. For example, if you're making a program about cars, you'd create a Car object that has properties like color, speed, and brand, plus methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate(). This approach makes code more reusable because once you define what a car is, you can create as many car objects as you need without rewriting all that code."

    "\n",
    "A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. Think of it as a cookie cutter - the class defines the shape and structure, but each cookie you make from it is a separate object. When you write a class, you're basically describing what attributes and behaviors all objects of that type should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you define a class using the `class` keyword. Inside the class, you specify what data the objects will hold (attributes) and what actions they can perform (methods). For instance, if you have a Student class, it might have attributes like name, age, and grade, plus methods like study() or take_exam(). The class itself doesn't store any actual student data - it just defines what every student object should look like."

    "\n",
    "An object is basically an instance of a class - it's the actual \"thing\" you create from the blueprint. While a class just describes what something should look like, an object is the real deal with actual data stored in it. Each object has its own set of attribute values, even though they all follow the same class structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an object from a class, you're instantiating it. So if you have a Person class, you might create objects like john = Person(\"John\", 25) and mary = Person(\"Mary\", 30). Both john and mary are separate objects with their own names and ages, but they both follow the Person class template. Objects can store different data and their methods can produce different results based on their individual attributes."

    "\n",
    "These two concepts often get mixed up, but they're actually pretty different. Abstraction is about hiding complexity and showing only the essential features of something. It's like when you drive a car - you don't need to know how the engine works internally, you just need to know that pressing the gas pedal makes it go faster. The complex engine mechanics are abstracted away from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data and methods together and controlling access to them. It's like putting your valuables in a safe - you're protecting the internal data from being accessed or modified directly from outside. In Python, you use things like private variables (with underscores) to achieve encapsulation. So basically, abstraction hides complexity while encapsulation hides and protects data."

The word \"dunder\" actually comes from \"double underscore\" - pretty clever, right? These methods are also called magic methods because they get called automatically in certain situations without you explicitly calling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you create a new object, Python automatically calls the __init__ method to initialize it. When you use the print() function on an object, it calls the __str__ method. When you check the length of an object with len(), it calls __len__. These methods let you define how your objects behave with built-in Python operations, which makes your custom classes feel more like native Python types. It's pretty neat how you can customize what happens when someone adds two of your objects together by defining __add__."

    "\n",
    "Inheritance is like a family tree for classes. When you have a class that shares some characteristics with another class, you can create a child class that inherits all the properties and methods from a parent class. The child class gets everything the parent has, plus it can add its own special features or modify existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this - you might have a general Animal class with basic things like name, age, and a make_sound() method. Then you can create specific classes like Dog or Cat that inherit from Animal. The Dog class automatically gets all the Animal features, but you can add dog-specific things like breed or override the make_sound() method to return \"Woof!\" instead of a generic animal sound. This saves you from writing the same code over and over again and helps organize your classes in a logical hierarchy."

    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fancy word that basically means \"many forms.\" In programming, it's the ability to use the same interface for different types of objects. The cool thing is that you can call the same method on different objects, and each object will handle it in its own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you have different shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, all with a calculate_area() method. Even though each shape calculates its area differently, you can just call calculate_area() on any shape object without worrying about which specific type it is. The circle will use π×r², the rectangle will use length×width, and the triangle will use its own formula. This makes your code more flexible because you can write functions that work with any shape without knowing the specific type beforehand."

    "## Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python achieves encapsulation through naming conventions and property decorators, though it's not as strict as some other languages. The main way is using underscores in variable and method names. A single underscore like _variable suggests it's for internal use (like a \"please don't touch\" sign), while double underscores like __variable make Python mangle the name to make it harder to access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use property decorators to create getter and setter methods that control how attributes are accessed and modified. This lets you add validation or calculations when someone tries to get or set a value. For example, you might have a property for age that ensures the value is always positive, or a property for email that validates the format. Python's approach is more about convention and giving developers the tools to control access rather than forcing strict privacy rules."

    "A constructor is basically the __init__ method in Python classes. It's the special method that gets called automatically when you create a new object from a class. Think of it as the setup function that prepares your object with initial values and gets everything ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor usually takes parameters that you pass when creating the object, and it uses those to set up the object's attributes. For example, when you write Person(\"John\", 25), Python calls the __init__ method with \"John\" and 25 as arguments, and the constructor assigns these values to the object's name and age attributes. You can also use the constructor to perform any other setup tasks your object needs, like opening files, establishing database connections, or calculating initial values. It's like the birth certificate of your object - it establishes who the object is and what it starts with."

    "Class methods and static methods are different types of methods you can have in a class, and they work differently from regular instance methods. A class method is marked with @classmethod decorator and receives the class itself as the first parameter (usually called cls) instead of an instance. These are useful for creating alternative constructors or methods that work with the class as a whole rather than individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods use the @staticmethod decorator and don't receive any special first parameter - they're basically regular functions that happen to be inside a class. You'd use static methods for utility functions that are related to the class but don't need access to either the instance or the class itself. For example, a Math class might have a static method for converting degrees to radians. The main difference is that class methods can access and modify class-level data, while static methods are more independent and just use the class as a namespace."

In languages like Java, you can have multiple methods called add() - one that takes two integers, another that takes three integers, etc. But Python doesn't work that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, only the last one defined will be kept. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using default parameters, *args, or **kwargs in your method definitions. You can also use techniques like checking the type or number of arguments inside the method to handle different cases. Some people also use the functools.singledispatch decorator to create overloaded-like behavior, but it's not the same as true method overloading."

It's like taking a recipe from your mom and tweaking it to make it your own way. The child class keeps the same method name and parameters, but changes what happens inside the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really useful when you want specialized behavior in your subclasses. For example, if you have an Animal class with a make_sound() method that returns \"Some generic animal sound\", you can override it in a Dog class to return \"Woof!\" and in a Cat class to return \"Meow!\". When you call make_sound() on a dog object, it uses the overridden version from the Dog class, not the generic one from Animal. This is how polymorphism works in practice - same method name, different behaviors depending on the object type."

Instead of having to call getter and setter methods like obj.get_name() and obj.set_name(), you can just use obj.name and Python will automatically call the appropriate method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use @property to mark a method as a getter, and then you can create setter and deleter methods using @name.setter and @name.deleter. This is super useful when you want to add validation, calculations, or other logic when someone accesses or modifies an attribute. For example, you might have a temperature property that automatically converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit, or an age property that ensures the value is never negative. The beauty is that from the outside, it looks like a simple attribute, but you have full control over what happens when it's accessed or changed."

When you write code that can work with different types of objects through the same interface, you don't have to rewrite everything when you add new types later. It's like having a universal remote that works with different brands of TVs - you don't need to learn a new remote for each TV.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility makes your programs more maintainable and reduces code duplication. Instead of writing separate functions for handling different types of shapes, employees, or vehicles, you can write one function that works with any object that has the required methods. This also makes testing easier because you can create mock objects that implement the same interface. Plus, it supports the \"open/closed principle\" - your code is open for extension but closed for modification, meaning you can add new features without changing existing code."

It's like having a blueprint that says \"any house built from this blueprint must have these rooms,\" but you can't actually live in the blueprint itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you create abstract classes using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module and the @abstractmethod decorator. The abstract class can have both regular methods with implementations and abstract methods that are just defined but not implemented. Any class that inherits from the abstract class must provide implementations for all the abstract methods, or Python will throw an error. This is useful when you want to ensure that certain methods exist in all subclasses while providing a common interface. For example, you might have an abstract Shape class that requires all shapes to implement calculate_area() and calculate_perimeter() methods."

First, it promotes code reusability through inheritance - once you write a class, you can extend it or use it as a base for other classes without rewriting everything. This saves a lot of time and reduces the chance of bugs since you're reusing tested code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big advantage is that OOP makes complex programs easier to understand and maintain. By organizing code into objects that represent real-world entities, it becomes more intuitive to think about the program's structure. Encapsulation helps by hiding implementation details and protecting data integrity. Polymorphism makes the code more flexible and extensible. Plus, OOP supports modular development, where different teams can work on different classes independently. When you need to fix a bug or add a feature, you usually only need to modify one class rather than searching through the entire codebase."

When you change a class variable, it affects all objects of that class. These are defined directly in the class, outside of any methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables, on the other hand, are unique to each object. They're like personal belongings that each person owns individually. Each object has its own copy of instance variables, and changing one object's instance variable doesn't affect other objects. These are usually created in the __init__ method using self.variable_name. For example, if you have a Student class, the school_name might be a class variable (same for all students), while name and age would be instance variables (different for each student). You can access class variables through either the class name or an instance, but it's clearer to use the class name."

In Python, you can specify multiple parent classes in the class definition by listing them in parentheses separated by commas.\n",

    "This can be really useful when you want to combine functionality from different classes. For example, you might have a class that inherits from both a Vehicle class and an Electric class to create an ElectricCar that has both vehicle properties and electric-specific features. However, multiple inheritance can get tricky when the parent classes have methods with the same name - this is called the \"diamond problem.\" Python handles this using Method Resolution Order (MRO), which determines which method gets called first.

    "The __repr__ method, on the other hand, is supposed to provide an unambiguous, developer-friendly representation that ideally could be used to recreate the object. It's what you see when you just type the object name in the Python shell or when the object appears in a list. The idea is that __repr__ should be precise and detailed, while __str__ should be readable and user-friendly. If you only define one of them, it's generally better to define __repr__ because Python will use it as a fallback for __str__ if __str__ isn't defined.

It also handles multiple inheritance correctly by following the Method Resolution Order (MRO). For example, if you have a Student class that inherits from Person, you can use super().__init__() in the Student's __init__ method to call the Person's initialization first, then add student-specific initialization.

It's the opposite of __init__ - while __init__ sets up the object, __del__ cleans up before the object disappears. However, you should be careful with __del__ because you can't predict exactly when it will be called, and sometimes it might not be called at all.\n",

    "The main use for __del__ is to clean up resources that won't be automatically cleaned up by Python's garbage collector, like closing files, database connections, or network sockets. But honestly, it's usually better to use context managers (with statements) or try/finally blocks for this kind of cleanup because they're more predictable. The __del__ method can also cause issues with circular references and make debugging harder.

    "Polymorphism with inheritance works through method overriding, where child classes provide their own implementations of methods defined in the parent class. When you call a method on an object, Python automatically uses the version from the most specific class in the inheritance hierarchy. This means you can have a list of different objects that all inherit from the same base class, and when you call the same method on each one, they'll behave differently based on their actual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have an Animal base class with a make_sound() method, and then Dog, Cat, and Bird classes that each override this method with their own sounds. If you have a list containing dog, cat, and bird objects, you can loop through them and call make_sound() on each one without knowing or caring what specific type each animal is. The dog will bark, the cat will meow, and the bird will chirp, all from the same method call. This is the power of polymorphism - same interface, different behaviors based on the object's type."

    "To implement method chaining, each method that you want to be chainable should return 'self' at the end. This allows the next method to be called on the same object. It makes code more readable and concise, especially when you need to perform multiple operations on the same object. For example, you might have a Calculator class where you can do calc.add(5).multiply(2).subtract(3) all in one line.

This is really useful when you want objects that can store state but still behave like functions.\n",

    "A common example is creating function-like objects that remember previous calls or have configuration settings. For instance, you might create a Counter class that keeps track of how many times it's been called, or a mathematical function object that stores coefficients for a polynomial equation. When you call the object, it uses those stored values to calculate and return a result. This pattern is also used in decorators, where the decorator class stores the original function and then becomes callable to replace it.
