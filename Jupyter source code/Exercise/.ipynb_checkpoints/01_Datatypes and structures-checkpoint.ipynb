    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Different data structures have different time complexities for operations like searching, inserting, and deleting\n",
    "2. **Memory Management**: They optimize how memory is used and allocated\n",
    "3. **Problem Solving**: Many algorithms depend on choosing the right data structure\n",
    "4. **Code Organization**: They make code more readable and maintainable\n",

    "2. The syntax for lists uses square brackets like [1, 2, 3], but for tuples, you use parentheses like (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "3. When it comes to performance, tuples are generally faster than lists.\n",
    "Tuples also use less memory compared to lists.\n",
    "4. You can't use lists as dictionary keys, but you can use tuples because they don't change.\n",
